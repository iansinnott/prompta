# Prompta Sync Server

This server handles syncing between Prompta clients. The main Prompta app is client-only, and works entirely standalone. This sync server allows client data to be synced. For example, if you use Prompta on your desktop and phone, the sync server allows you to keep your chat message history in sync.

An instance of this server is publicly hosted and available at <https://prompta-production.up.railway.app>, but you can deploy your own instance if you would like to self-host.
